# why is it called "vr spigot recorder?"
The plugin was originally made to record VR inputs and play them back for cutscenes. The project that this was made for is still in progress, but is on hold. However, this is only a secondary feature that is actually completely disabled in all public builds. If you want to use the recording features, build the project with `build__forCutsceneRecordings` set to true.

TL;DR plugin was meant to record and show vr, now only shows vr.

Commands:

/rgn - Regain your hands if they somehow disappear

/scale (scale; -Infinity to Infinity) - Since WorldScale isn't tracked in VSE, this allows you to manually set how big your hands and head are.

[DISABLED] /record - Originally meant to record and save cutscenes to a .vrrec file
